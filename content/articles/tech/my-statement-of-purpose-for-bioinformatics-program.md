Here is my 'Statement of Purpose' what I submitted for getting admission in [Bioinformatics program](http://www.memphis.edu/bioinformatics/) of University of Memphis at Tennessee, USA.

Writing this SOP was started while I was getting back home through my office bus. 
The first draft was written on my mobile,LG KU990, as a note within 1000 characters limit. 

You can read it here. You can also download it ... But I will strongly prohibit to using just 'copy-paste'. And this,
