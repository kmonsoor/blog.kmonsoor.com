### Please Note
If you are stuck with **Windows 7**, operating system of your PC, in a foreign language, this is not what you are looking for. Please check out [my relevant post](https://blog.kmonsoor.com/convert-windows-7-k-to-en/).



## Background

As I have worked for a giant Korean conglomerate, I have to install Office 2007 Enterprise edition Korean version. I hunted, searched, tested many ways to convert/choose for English. But failed.

But, now, I got it. Here's how.

## Process

 1.  At first, check  of your desired language file (**matching** with your version of Office) [here](http://goo.gl/QX3Yf). For **Office 2010**, check [here](http://goo.gl/cJM8M).
 2.  If it is there, voilà! You got it.
 3.  Install the downloaded EXE file. As a security check, plz check the publisher name if it is "Microsoft" or not.
     If it is “Microsoft”, you have nothing to worry about security.  
 4.  After completion, please restart your PC or laptop whether Windows tells so or not.
 5.  Now, check using MS Office Language preference that is it set or not as below:

6.  Now, happily use "Office" in your desired language.

Though I didn't believe at first place. But it worked anyway.
