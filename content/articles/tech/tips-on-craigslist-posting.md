-   **Try to give best "image"**
    -   Don't upload big image file(s). Else Craigslist's own
        compression will make your image too bad.
    -   Adjust light and proper angle before you take shot. If the item
        is a outside one like car, grill etc., utilize daylight or
        evening time ambient light<!--more-->
    -   Take snapshot with a good camera
    -   Take picture from different angle. You can add up to 4(four)
        images. Utilize 'em all.
    -   Re-size the image(s) with MS paint
    -   Crop any unnecessary portion
    -   Now, post on to Craigslist
    -   a blurry image can ruin your post
    -   for any crack/scratch on your to-, use *MS Paint*'s circle,
        arrow, line, and text to CLEARLY SHOW  that.
-   **Secure your privacy** by giving phone number with some inside text
    like 2 Zero 1 - 255 - Three 5 Five 4 to avoid automatic reapers. If
    possible, use a secondary or temporary phone number. You may
    consider to get a phone number such as, [Google
    Voice](http://www.google.com/voice "Google Voice") number, for free.
-   **Wait** for the right customer, Don't hurry & get-down at a poor
    offer; unless you have set an absurd price
