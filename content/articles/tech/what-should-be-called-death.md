I just watched a National Geographic documentary "Moments of death". I
am just describing its idea & my thought.

what is death? whom you will call 'dead'?  
A man with stopped heart-beat, a man with non-functioning brain, a girl
who can't response to any physical/worldly impulsion or a man who is
totally out of his mind? Our understanding of the definition or the
process of 'being dead' is pushing the boundaries...

Do you acknowledge 'soul'? Why?

The 'simple' physical process of cardio-vascular death is as follows.
The heart stops pumping blood, the organs get shut-off one-by-one, at
last the brain-cells, being deprived of Oxygen, raise 'panic' alarm,
every element of brain-cell start fighting to save own-self and start
producing toxic waste enormously, then each cell get self-destroyed.

Now, if you 'shock' back the heart-beating, give external oxygen quick
enough, then the brain-cell 'may' stuck in 'somewhere-in-middle'. The
patient is now seems breathing, and heart is beating; but he can't sense
or response to anything, even you cut-off any organ without anesthesia.
Its called 'coma'. In this state, the patient is may be thinking,
dreaming, or just 'nothing'. Why not he is dead ?

{ purpose of Germany's 'house of dead' was to avoid live-burial }

{ the case of the girl who totally went out-of-mind and parents wanted
to declare her dead }

{ why peoples, 'visited' around death, see light or tunnel of light }

Is 'soul' really exists?  
{experience of a 'unconscious-and-tapped-eye' open-heart-surgery
patient who saw every steps of his surgery, even his own body and an
unusual habit of the surgeon}

{ the medical & ethical boundary of the definition of 'death' }
