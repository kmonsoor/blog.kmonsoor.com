Summary: You should open-source as-if you gonna die tonight. Literally.

***[ To keep the spirit of this post honest, i am going to publish this blog, immidiately. No __draft__-ing. This post will be, i hope, under improvement continuously. This post is, right now, in version 0.0.1]***
  
  

**Yes, I mean it. Literally.**

I see too many post/comments/blogs in different gathering-places for techies e.g. hackernews, reddit, etc. which implies the same thing. 

> "I am working on ***something*** which I will open-source/publish
> ***someday*** after taking it ***somewhere***."

See the ambiguous sense in the words?  

Unless the code/script/blog you are working on is something sensitive which will make a mess published in "draft"-situation, you should not wait that special "someday". Or, unless you have thousands of subscribers for you blog posts, of course.

Or, if you decided that you ***never*** gonna publish it in public, that's entirely different story.

If it is something of your company's code-base, commit it in your remote-branch. So that your work of last 19-days isn't just gone just because you are "gone".

**As human, we are far more fragile than we think.**


Frequently shared confusions (FSQ)
------------------------------------
 * What if this is just plain crap ?  
 **A.** Are you sure? You never know for sure. Throw it in the wild. If it is really crap, nobody will remember or hold you responsible for it. How many crappy de-Vinci paintings you know? I guess, ***none.** But, [Monalisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa) didn't just appear from thin air. Did it?
   
 * This is my toy(or, pet) project.  
 **A.** Don't be that selfish kid from the school who don't let others touch it just because. If you are having fun building something why don't let others join in the fun.
   
 * this is a one-off script on this *COBOL* platform, no one gonna need it.  Ever.
 **A.** You never know. You are a human. You can't imagine what people gonna need. Throw it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/), just include a suitable title. Add in some comments if you please. May be couple of years later, your script gonna save someone's job, hence his family's bread-on-the-table. You never know.  
   
 * If i publish this now, some genius, with free time, will take away this idea and make it something grand without me.  
 **A.** Unless, you are a big hot-shot throwing a ground-breaking idea, no one gonna even notice it. Most _genius'_ mind is already idea-ed down with their own to-do list. Even if they take away, let them. You move on. 
 Don't be a muddy pond, rather be like a river. Rivers don't dry off due to peasents are "stealing" some water.  
   
 * Around this post, i haven't collected my thoughts around it to make it a grand one.  
 **A.** Don't think of yourself too high. Let others do that for you.  
 No project born grand, no great man born great. Your contributions is what goes ahead. You the person? Not so much. Time passed along the "Romeo & Juliet", not much the "person" Shakespeare.  
 
 * I am special. My words/codes should be special, perfect, coherent like a pearl-necklace.  _(yes, we all do it, just don't acknowledge it publicly.)_  
 **A.** No, you are not. You are not something that special unique snowflake. See the previous answer.
 
 * Who the \*\*\*k are you to tell me what to do?  
 **A.** It's not about me, I am nobody. Just a open-source enthusiast to see more open-source projects, scripts, blog-posts which don't necessarily have to go to the graves along their mortal creators. Here, am sharing just sharing my thinking around it.
 **It is your code in your own personal pc, after all.**
  
  
Why should I open my "source" right tonight ?
--------------------
 * You can literally die tonight. 
 And, all your pet-projects are just gone. 'Cause probably none in your family is in coding business or they aren't sure about your intention. 
  
 * Tomorrow morning, your mind will just drift-away.  
 What is a vivid idea tonight which can impact thousands of people's life, tomorrow morning it will become a faded, will-do-it-someday idea. One month after tonight, you probably become just oblivious about your own idea, draft, script, code.

 * It's a mind-trick to force it work on something to avoid public shame. We feel obliged to correct errata that is in public, not even 2% of that if it is in private, hidden in some local folder. 
  
  
  
To avoid the embarrassment
----------------------------
 * Make sure your audience (or colleague for that matter) know the content's status. Put a "prelude" section mentioning the half-done condition. Better, use some version number.
  
 * Make it clear what it is all about. For coding staffs, roughly point out what it is, what it is supposed to do. For blog, present the basic idea at least, even it is not with a pertfect grammer.
  
  
How infrastructure can improve
--------------------
Open-source mainstreamers e.g. Github, Bitbucket, GitLab etc. could have a **"Open the source"** trigger-switch for individual projects where a software developer can enable the trigger with some condition like:

  * "**Open the source**" if I don't login Github for `1 year` (which means I am dead or gone crazy to remember Github)
  * "**Open the source**" on a pre-set date e.g. `2020-02-20`
