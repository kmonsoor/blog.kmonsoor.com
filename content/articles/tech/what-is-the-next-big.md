which is overwhelmed by the thrust of a single drop of anti-fungal  
which is overwhelmed by a splash of water  
which is overwhelmed by a room heater

which is overwhelmed by e.m.f of the electric system of the skyscraper  
which is overwhelmed by the power-grid of the city  
which is overwhelmed by the size of the New York city

which is overwhelmed by the 'little' ice cubes of the Arctics  
which is overwhelmed by a bright-shine of a sun-storm  
which is overwhelmed by the vastness of the sun  
which is overwhelmed by the size of a white "Dwarf"  
which is overwhelmed by its own galaxy  
which is overwhelmed by the number of galaxies in Universe  
which is overwhelmed by ... ?
