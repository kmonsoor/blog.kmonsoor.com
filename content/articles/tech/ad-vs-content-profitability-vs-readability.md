*P.S. I am basically a software engineer, while i am writing this up as
just as an UX enthusiast's fan out of frustrations. So, never mind if
you are an expert on this subject matter.*

For quite a while, i am totally unhappy with overall readability of most
of the web sites, especially the heavy traffic sites. Why they make
their pages filled with crapland-ish ads? To add a little salt on the
burn, they kept doing pagination. As a preventive measure, I kept using
browser-extensions like
[readability](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi),
[minimalistic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimalist-for-everything/bmihblnpomgpjkfddepdpdafhhepdbek),
[hacker
vision](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hacker-vision/fommidcneendjonelhhhkmoekeicedej)
etc.  
Is that so tough to create well-designed site with keeping up site's
profitability? In their long run, does their insane amount of ad-pushing
don't hurt or not?

A question on UX.StackExchange just fueled my frustrations. [[Is there a
point to paginating articles
online?](http://ux.stackexchange.com/q/21375/21647)]

IMAO, Most of the high-traffic sites still miss some very important
points from user perspective.

-   **Over the time**, since the online era, our subconscious as well as
    conscious mind are well-trained to ignore ads altogether and focus
    on the content, mostly on relevant picture. e.g. when i entered a
    NYTimes for news on Iraq, the new shiny Ford(ad) is totally
    irrelevant (hence, irritating). In return, my subconscious mind take
    a silent note on this irritation (entirely due to the ad).
-   **As a try to address** the fact, ad engines (syndicates) tried to
    deliver contextual ads and collect and relate search data.
-   **What is the result?**  once i just needed to know(so, searched) a
    fact about Nikon D800. Now, everywhere i just see ads of DSLRs. As i
    already have one, i am not even remotely interested to buy another
    one. Now, what? My irritation just got a polynomial factor.
-    **Our monitors**, even on laptops, are mostly now widescreen(16:9)
    rather than archaic 4:3. But, the sites mostly are failing to adopt
    the new display real-estate. Instead the ad's column (on the right)
    just multiplied.

-   **Yet still, Pagination** is the worst factor to "dishonor" the
    visitor's "mission statement". Dividing a single writeup into 4
    pages for the sake of showing ads, is just like "holy" water from a
    fountain of hell. Pagination has being tagged along from the dawn of
    Internet to break the "payload" into smaller pieces due to slow
    bandwidth. But now, used as wonderful way to push ads.  Wherever i
    see  *"<span style="text-align:center;line-height:1.5em;">Page |  1
    |</span>**2**<span style="text-align:center;line-height:1.5em;"> | 3
    | 4|",</span>*<span style="text-align:center;line-height:1.5em;">my
    subconscious tells me that as</span>*<span
    style="text-align:center;line-height:1.5em;"> "the content is not
    for reading, just a packet for ads." or "why bother to read that
    all? Let's click some ads"</span>*

-   Every time, i want to see the text bigger, i got to do CTRL+Scroll
    on mouse.
-   I don't remember the last time i clicked an ad. When were your last
    time?  Seems like ***"ads, ads everywhere. nor any drop to
    click".***

In my Utopian world of Internet,  i would design reading-friendly and
readable (yet, revenue generating) site like this.

What do you think ?
