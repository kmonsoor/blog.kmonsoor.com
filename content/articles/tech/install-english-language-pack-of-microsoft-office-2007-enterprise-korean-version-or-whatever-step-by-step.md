If you are stuck with Windows 7 in Korean package, this is not the place
you are looking for. Plz check out my relevant post.

[Background]
------------

As I have joined a giant Korean conglomerate aka group of companies, I
have to install Office 2007 Enterprise edition Korean version. I hunted,
searched, tested many ways. But failed.

But, now, I got it. Here's how.

[Process]
---------

1.  At first, check  of your desired language file (**matching** with
    your version of Office) [here  
   ](http://goo.gl/QX3Yf). For **Office 2010**, check
    [here](http://goo.gl/cJM8M).
2.  If it is there, voilà! You got it.
3.  Install the downloaded exe file. As a security check, plz check the
    publisher name if it is "Microsoft" or not. If it is “Microsoft”,
    you have nothing to worry about security.
4.  After completion, please restart your PC or laptop whether Windows
    tells so or not.
5.  Now, check using MS Office Language preference that is it set or not
    as below:
