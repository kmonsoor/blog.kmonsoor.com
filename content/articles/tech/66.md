Throughout my computing experience since 1993, I have faced, searched,
installed, tried, loved, hated, and uninstalled quite numerous software.
Maybe, the number will cross thousand. The list includes pirated,
licensed, shareware, freeware and what not. Their domain includes
Windows \*, Linux \*, HP-UX 9i but (bad)luckily not Mac OS or NeXT
platforms. I am sorry Mr. Jobs.

<a name="more" target="_blank"></a>

As the sold software including licensed and shareware involve the factor
of direct cash, they have a lot many guys (and obviously nice gals) to
talk about their greatness. As a relatively poor guy, I could never love
them. Rather I loved those ones which I can use legally free. Along with
that point, here comes Linux, Java etc.

<div>

There is a great misconception in mass people, even some tech peoples,
that the free software are "obviously" of inferior quality. That
perception is inherently wrong. For example, web servers, research
facilities, including NASA, just can't rely on purchased Windows for
their mission-critical applications,[ rather most of them are
using](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Servers.2C_mainframes_and_supercomputers) [Linux
variants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions). Not
only for techies, now Linux
(especially, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)) is quite user-friendly
for mass people, even for your grandma.

</div>

<div>

Anyway, bragging Linux isn't point of this post. Rather I would like to
share with you some of the awesome **free software** for everyday use
that I just **love**.

It just started a new era for Internet browsers. Unmatched blitz-like
speed with no-compromise safety is its main beauty. For giving a test
result for this blog, I have done a little test. For loading msn.com and
yahoo.com on my brand new laptop, Chrome(v.10) took approx. 3 seconds
each whereas our-old-hero Firefox (v.4) took 7 seconds each. What about
your browser? How many hours you wasted just on waiting for the webpage
to load?

Where pirated software are reigning, you may have no headache about
purchasing price of operating systems. But when the question comes about
legality, such as in the case of government agencies, business or
education institutions, they just can't use illegal one's. And Windows
means a boat-load of cash along with almost no everyday software. Where
much-better performer Ubuntu comes for free with its cool features and
sexy user interface and also with a great lot of everyday software
including [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/). Oh! my personal
experience about Ubuntu? Just awesome !

</div>

Needless to say, simply greatest. Far ahead from other email services
regarding user friendliness, speed, forwarding, great spam-filtering and
a hell lot more features. Many global organizations are using that
professionally. Personally I use different accounts for different level
of privacy and also turned on many cool features of
Gmail [labs](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/introducing-gmail-labs.html).

</div>

Extremely fast to load PDF files and extremely light on memory, where on
the other hand, the default Adobe Acrobat Reader work like a memory hog.

</div>

Very smart and supports almost all archive files. It also has a
nice integration (with the Right-click-menu on Windows Explorer). It’s
very fast rather than the built-in compression-handler of Windows.

Advanced Text Editing: [Notepad ++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

</div>

<div>

Haven't you ever felt that you need something basic text editing
software which has advanced feature than the crappy Notepad software
which comes with Windows. I always feel that way.

</div>

<div>

When I need:

</div>

<div>

Removing text-formatting from some text to paste somewhere else,

</div>

<div>

Edit/delete or insert Vertical block of text in a file

</div>

<div>

analyze some big...really big file which is basically text but size is
like 1GB in a single file.

</div>

<div>

....

</div>

<div>

and many other operations on basic text. Not only me, a great many
number of developers, data analysts, and who not use Notepad++

Fast and furiously smart email client. Though some
unused glossy features of Microsoft Outlook isn't present with that, but
I am impressed.

</div>

Though free 2GB space isn't that much, but quite enough for personal
documents and important pictures. And continuous, seamless
and hassle-less device-independent file syncing service and its
performance is just amazing.

[Image Resizer for Windows](http://imageresizer.codeplex.com/releases/view/82827)

</div>

<p>
Some of us daily need to resize image files easily. But only hope was
Microsoft Paint. Another was crack-licensed ACDSee. But loading a
full-fledged software for such a trivial task was a common but great
pain.  
**  
**  
**ImageResizer **is their lighthouse of hope. Open-source, free,
lightweight, just add a option to right-click menu. Just right-click on
the image and select "Resize Pictures". Select what size you want, and
see the magic of making tiny-sized-okay-quality image.

For the sake of brevity, here I am just sharing seven most-used ones. I
would also love to know what are your favorites? You can share them with
us by leaving some comments below. I may also update that in my post.
