live in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Now.

Today, I have suffered a lot for (re)installing the Chrome browser on my
office laptop. Installer was downloaded,

but when I ran it, it was stuck in "***Connecting to internet***..."

and after a long time It showed an error message that
***"GoogleUpdate.exe cannot connect to Internet"***

<!--more-->

At first, I thought the firewall or company domain is blocking that. But
after a heck lot of hacking, working around, I confirmed that I am
wrong. Due to Bangladesh Govt. recent (but now uplifted) anti-Google
policy, the outgoing traffic is being blocked.

So, the solution is to download standalone version which will not need
internet to be installed on PC. Its about 30 MB in size. But, from where
will you download this ?!?

It's always best to download latest ones from here:
<http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?standalone=1>

or, else you can download it from my hosted mirror on Dropbox:

***(Update)***** **Please download the latest one on this
link: <http://goo.gl/NXrBz>

If you download the hosted one, you need to check the security/integrity
of the downloaded file, by checking the publisher when you'll run the
downloaded installer application. Like below:

this cannot be changed except by Google
itself.](http://kmonsoor.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screenshot050.png "Check File's Integrity")](http://kmonsoor.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screenshot050.png)
