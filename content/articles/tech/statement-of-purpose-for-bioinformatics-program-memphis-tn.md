Here I published the 'Statement of Purpose' what I used for getting
admission in Bioinformatics program of University of Memphis at
Tennessee, USA.Writing this SOP was started while I was getting back
home through my Aktel stuff bus. The backbone was written on my mobile
LG KU 990 as a note. I fulfilled its 1000 characters limit.You can read
it [here on my scribd.com space](http://www.scribd.com/doc/42898955).
You can also download it ... But I will strongly prohibit to using just
'***copy-paste***'. And [this
