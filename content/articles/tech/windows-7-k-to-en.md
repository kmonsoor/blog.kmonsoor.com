Ended up with Windows 7 Enterprise in Korean language? What you are seeing, all are in Korean() language ? I am here to share my own experience. It may help you out. 

As I was working for a South Korean conglomerate, I had access to Windows 7 Enterprise K. So, I have to face a lot of trouble to make the conversion to English. As, there is no Microsoft's official help available, I have to find it myself.  It would be great if I can share this with proper screen-shots of Korean Windows. But as I had already converted, I could not. Sorry about that.

 
First of all, it will be best if you can install Windows 7 English version directly. If not possible at all, like your company have license only to use Korean version, or you purchased your laptop or PC in Korea. In those cases this post may help.   
 
I am **assuming** that: 
You have a valid license key or OEM VLK(Volume License Key) of Windows 7, either for Enterprise or for Ultimate edition.  
If you don't have Enterprise or Ultimate edition, rather you have Home or Professional addition. Because the following method probably won't work.   
 
## Steps:

-   Install **Windows 7 K** on your PC; don't setup any setting if you don't understand what it is saying.
-   Don't install any anti-virus yet. Or any other system software.
-   Validate and register your license.
-   Go to Windows update.  
    And update your Windows to Service pack 1. Please **avoid** updating
    Internet Explorer 8 to 9. Uncheck it.
-   Now Windows will restart automatically.
-   Again, Go to Windows update. In the ***optional*** section, you'll will see a long list of language pack. Select *English*. 
-   Complete update. Again restart.
-   If your *Windows 7 K* is not converted to *Windows 7(English)* then from Language setting choose *English* as display language.
-   Again, restart. Now it should be in English. Some text still may be in Korean. Don't care for it. Your life will be quite okay with that.
-   Now you install whatever software you want.
-   if you are in trouble now with MS Office Korean package, check out [my relevant

### P.S.
I don't know why *Internet Explorer 9* don't work properly. If you face problem after installing it like "I.E. is not responding....","I.E. closed unexpectedly" etc. just uninstall that.  

But how? [Please visit my relevant post.](http://kmonsoor.blogspot.com/2012/01/uninstall-crappy-and-slow-internet.html)
