I got the masterpiece article "How Browsers Work" through
[HTML5rocks.com](http://HTML5rocks.com "HTML5rocks.com"). But wondering
to find a printer-friendly version, or PDF of the article. "Not found"

Then I followed the original articles link to [Tali's
site](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm) to get that.
"Not found".

That's why I decided to publish my own printing-friendly as well as
reading-friendly "formatted" version of the great article. I didn't
modify the content of the article, not even a single word. I did only
the formatting. That took several hours. :)

Here it is: <http://bit.ly/howBrowsersWorkPDF>
