you love to read news, or blog or magazine but hate to do it on your
smartphone or tab ...... now it's time to embrace the ***digital
readership***. Here comes "Google Currents".

Yesterday, I accidentally metÂ "Google Currents" and got curious. The
description itself is hazy, not give the sense what it'll do. But wait,
how could it explain ? It's totally new revolutionary way to engage your
readership into fun. Just install on your iPhone or Android phone and
see how nice a productive software can be. BTW, all "editions"(contents'
name for ***Currents***) are free for this application.

You can get it right away here at [Google Currents

But, according to me, it's simply awesome.

### What's cool:

-   Offline reading is possible
-   You can easily check the trends, i.e. what's goin' on web
-   Partitioning of the reading space that makes sense
-   Awesome font rendering on phone/tab screen
-   Already included some great subscriptions

### What's not yet:

-   Integration of [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/)
    subscription
-   Why publication(aka markeing) of this great app is so poor ?
