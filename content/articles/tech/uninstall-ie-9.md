Summary: Internet Explorer 9 is a buggy, sticky beast. It don't go away easily. But, here's the help you need.

![internet-explorer-9-logo](http://i.imgur.com/JOhjvDX.png)  **DON'T do it from "Control Panel"\>\>"Programs"\>\>"Turn Windows Features on or off".**  
That will cause more trouble. Yes, looking at you, Microsoft.

Here's how to do it cleanly.

 * Go to START --> "Control panel" --> "View installed updates",
 * Now scroll down the list, look for **Windows Internet Explorer 9** in **Microsoft Windows** section,
 * Double-click to Uninstall it,
 * After finishing, it's better if you restart immediately,
 * Your previous IE 8 will be restored,
 * If you can't find IE 8 yet by typing "Internet" in the START \>\> "Search for programs and files", [download **IE 8** from here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-8).  
 However, don't forget to select right language and right OS version. Install the downloaded file as usual.

**However, I highly recommend**, as your day-to-day browser, and as a truly faster, secure and reliable Internet browser, consider using [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome?hl=en) or [Firefox browser (To get now, click here)](http://goo.gl/OhvkY)
