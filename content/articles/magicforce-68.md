Summary: After a bit of researching for an test-entry mechanical keyboards, I decided to spend $60 on Magicforce-68 built-with Gateron-Brown switches. How'd it turn out?

For office-workers especially IT-related workers have to bash their keyboards all day long. And, for most of us it's not a enjoyable hassle.
We are mostly fatigued, RSI-ed, but not only on mondays. For my case, it's also my fatigued fingers as well as right-shoulder pain.
I's looking for a viable solution for all these to go away.
