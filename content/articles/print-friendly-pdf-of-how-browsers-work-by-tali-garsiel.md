I got the masterpiece article "How Browsers Work" through HTML5rocks.com. But wondering to find a printer-friendly version, or PDF of the article. "Not found"

Then I followed the original articles link to Tali's site to get that. "Not found".

That's why I decided to make and share my own printing-friendly as well as reading-friendly "formatted" version of the great article. I didn't modify the content of the article, not even a single word. I did only the formatting. That took several hours. :)

Here it is: https://bit.ly/howTheBrowsersWork

For non-commercial use, feel free to use or share my edition. I don't know exactly if you should use this piece commercially.
