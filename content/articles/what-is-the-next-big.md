which is overwhelmed by a room heater

which is overwhelmed by the ‘little’ ice cubes of the Arctics  
which is overwhelmed by a bright-shine of a sun-storm  
which is overwhelmed by the vastness of the sun  
which is overwhelmed by the size of a white “Dwarf”  
which is overwhelmed by its own galaxy  
which is overwhelmed by the number of galaxies in Universe
