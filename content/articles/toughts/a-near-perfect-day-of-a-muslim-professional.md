# A Near-Perfect Day of a Muslim Professional

Life is all about the choices we make. We go through new experiences every single day. 
Each of our decisions make or break the path for the next opportunity or disaster. Be it for our worldly life or the life-after.

As a somewhat-practising Muslim guy, who happened to be a software engineer, I feel that my schedule or planning of daily life or work cannot be the same of a non-practising colleague whose life-plan is somewhat undefined.
Just can't.

So, in light of my current understanding of Islam, and the sunnah of Muhammad (ï·º: peace be upon him), as well as all my gathered life-hacks, I planned to design a optimal timeline or schedule of my 24H daily life which enhances both my dun'yaa and akhiraat fulfilling all my physical & spiritual needs. This also should boost your career, nonetheless, due to cutting out the slack and distractions from our working time.

#### P.S.
Colleagues from any other religion can benefit from this schedule as well. Just replace Islam-specific mentions with your spiritual activities or self-realization related engagement. People from other professions can also benefit from this, but may require some job-specific tuning.


Ok, without much ado, here is the sketchup for a ideal working day.

## The Schedule

### At home

4.00 AM  :   Leave the bed, doing some basic stretching, then wash-up.

4.25 AM  :   Tahajjud. Jikrullah. Dua' especially if I have something critical today

5.00 AM  :   Light snacks, e.g. cookies, eggs, milk

5.15 AM  :   Fazr salat, then daily dua's, and recitation from al-Quran

### At work

8.00 AM  :  Entering workplace. Don't go for coffee, chit-chat or Facebook. Don't even check work email. Start your working hours with your most difficult/critical task at hand while it's still quiet in the office. If you have any diffcult concept to grasp or painstaking bug you need to fix, start that now. This is your golden moment.
