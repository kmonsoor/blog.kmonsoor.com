Summary: Among the thousands of combinations a company can take to choose from the cloud providers and their products, this is my TL;DR suggestion

The sheer number of combinations a company can choose from the cloud providers and their product suites is mind-boggling. Hence, I decided to break it down in a concise form, for the busy C-suite executives.

According to my little experiences and humble opinion, I suggest ...

âž¤ If your company is a small SaaS shop with 10-ish engineers, stick with DigitalOcean, Linode, OVH, etc. which are best known as cloud "instance" providers.  
Think McDonald's; reliable, cheapest, fast, but you won't take your date there.   
**Budget**: ðŸ’°

âž¤ If you want a whole cloud experience (e.g. VPC, firewall, WAF, etc., on the menu), start with Google Cloud, then try AWS later.  
Google Cloud would be the quickest to grasp the cloud concepts and get going. The UI of AWS console is a bit messy in comparison to GCP; just takes more time to get a proper grip.  
Imagine them as full-course, Michelin-star restaurants. However, the product names are so abstract that they need a full-sized chart for that. ;) 
**Budget**: ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

âž¤ Are you planning to set up a million-dollar infra for a billion-dollar company? Go for some GCP+AWS multi-cloud setup. You gonna get rebates from both in scale of hundred of thousands of dollars. And Microsoft Azure gonna offer you some million-$ free-tier, hoping to get the company hooked on Azure. :D 
**Budget**: ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

âž¤ On the other hand, if you run a govt agency or a company where wearing suits is the mainstream, Microsoft Azure is your best bet.  
A whole bunch of consultancy companies to choose from; you need to just approve the budget, you get the things get up & running but missing the deadline by months, if not years. But there'd be no need for hiring more smarter ppl than that of you already have. 
**Budget**: ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’¸
