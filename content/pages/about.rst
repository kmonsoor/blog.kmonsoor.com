:summary: About me

Hi there, I’m Silviu a 27 year old guy living in Denmark, I’m a system administrator, computer geek, web designer/developer and like tinkering with computers in general.

I consider myself a very calm and outgoing introverted person, I enjoy social interaction but I need to be by myself to recharge and organize thoughts from time to time. Whenever I want to relax I like to listen to music, cook or read a book.

I love technology and challenges, I always find a great satisfaction in solving difficult problems and applying my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. I like to consider myself as a team player, quick learner, independent and self-motivated individual that feels comfortable working in a fast paced environment that evolves rapidly.
