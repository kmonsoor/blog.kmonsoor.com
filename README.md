Please feel free to fork and make your own blog. Just make sure that you don't use the `contents/articles` folder of this repo. ;)

The source code is heavily in debt of [razius/razius.com](https://github.com/razius/razius.com) and some other awesome persons.
I've used bootstrap-based theme [Plumage by Kevin Deldycke](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) for this blog.
