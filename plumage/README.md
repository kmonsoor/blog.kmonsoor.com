Plumage
=======

Plumage is a theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), a static site
generator written in Python.

I initially created this theme for [my blog](http://kevin.deldycke.com), but
now the theme is supposed to be generic enough to have its own repository.

`pelicanconf.py` file:

Most of these [parameters are similar to `notmyidea`'s
](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html#themes) (Pelican's default
theme). For usage example, please have a look into [my own `pelicanconf.py`
](https://github.com/kdeldycke/kevin-deldycke-blog/blob/master/pelicanconf.py).

The theme is also sensible to this list of [standard Pelican parameters
