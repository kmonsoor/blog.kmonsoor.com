Duh?! you might be thinking. But hold that thought for a moment. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t so much about the money you can make but about fixing the internal issues holding you from the 100x, which you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to make&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROI&lt;/span&gt; should be in the 100x range, if not&amp;nbsp;1000x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="invest-in-your-physical-health-and-fitness"&gt;Invest in your physical health and fitness&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#invest-in-your-physical-health-and-fitness" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat proper food, and secure some time to exercise regularly. Even better, if you can afford it, consult a real-life fitness trainer, not some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;bozo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="invest-in-your-mental-health"&gt;Invest in your mental health&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#invest-in-your-mental-health" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to a trained mental health professional. Find out if there&amp;rsquo;s any childhood trauma, subconscious burden, or any mental illness you&amp;rsquo;re carrying. Then, actively work on resolving it. There&amp;rsquo;s no shame in having an issue, but it&amp;rsquo;s not right to make the closed ones suffer because of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="invest-in-continuous-education"&gt;Invest in continuous education&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#invest-in-continuous-education" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not talking about another degree or a certificate course. What I mean is about continuously educating yourself to be a better person, a true leader, a effective planner, and such. Learning can be done in many forms &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; shapes. There are so many resources online or offline; free or paid; be it books, videos, podcasts, blogs, etc. you name it. Choose the one that fits your lifestyle and daily schedule.&lt;br&gt;
Regardless of the medium, make an active habit of keep&amp;nbsp;learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="buy-time"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;Buy&amp;rdquo; time&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#buy-time" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one sounds a bit edgy, right? I know. But, hold on for a moment.
This investment is good to go after you have started taking care of the previous ones. Then, the next best thing is to &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; more time for yourself. I mean, save your own time by delegating chore-like repetitive tasks to others who are willing to do it for less. Everyone isn&amp;rsquo;t in the same financial position, and that&amp;rsquo;s how it works. When considering something to buy, don&amp;rsquo;t just consider it&amp;rsquo;s upfront price; consider how much time you have to spend to make it usable.
Now, re-invest the saved time in something more productive. When you have a lot of time to spare, you can do&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be productive, be happy. Then, please share the happiness with&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category><category term="Thoughts"></category><category term="investing"></category><category term="self-care"></category><category term="happiness"></category></entry></feed>
